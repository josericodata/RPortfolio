# Classic Models In R

## Background
**Intention:** Here we will explore the R programming language. R is used among data miners, bioinformaticians, and statisticians for data analysis. In my case, I will use some of the infinite graphs that R offers. As we did in Python, we will be querying from MySQL to import dataframes into R.

## Technology
As mentioned, we will use R Studio.

## Dataset
**Classic Models** will be used again as the dataset.

## Scenarios

### Scenario 1:
Before plotting any data in R, we have to establish a connection with MySQL. Please refer to the following [link](https://www.projectpro.io/recipes/connect-mysql-r) that worked for me. The following libraries are needed to connect to MySQL: `RODBC`, `DBI`, and `odbc`. Once we get `conn1`, there is no need to run it every time we query SQL. Now, let us see how we get `df_1`:
```bash
library(RODBC)
library(DBI)
library(odbc)
conn1 <- odbcConnect("MySQL_DNS")#Stablishing connection with MySQL

df_1 <-sqlQuery(conn1,'SELECT * FROM employees;') #Creating df_1

df_1#Printing results from df_1
```

After printing out `df_1`:

To close this scenario, we will represent how many rows each table has. For that, we need the library `ggplot2`.
```bash
#Creating df_2
df_2 <-sqlQuery(conn1,"SELECT 'Customers' AS 'Table', COUNT(*) AS Num_Rows FROM customers
                    UNION
                    SELECT 'Employees' AS 'Table', COUNT(*) AS Num_Rows FROM employees
                    UNION
                    SELECT 'Offices' AS 'Table', COUNT(*) AS Num_Rows FROM offices
                    UNION
                    SELECT 'Order Details' AS 'Table', COUNT(*) AS Num_Rows FROM orderdetails
                    UNION
                    SELECT 'Orders' AS 'Table', COUNT(*) AS Num_Rows FROM orders
                    UNION
                    SELECT 'Payments' AS 'Table', COUNT(*) AS Num_Rows FROM payments
                    UNION
                    SELECT 'Product Lines' AS 'Table', COUNT(*) AS Num_Rows FROM productlines
                    UNION
                    SELECT 'Products' AS 'Table', COUNT(*) AS Num_Rows FROM products;")

library(ggplot2) #importing library
theme_set(theme_classic())

# Plot
g <- ggplot(df_2, aes(Table, Num_Rows))
g + geom_bar(stat="identity", width = 0.5, fill="tomato2") + 
theme(text = element_text(size = 20))+
  labs(title="Bar Chart", 
       subtitle="Records per table in classicmodels DB", 
       caption="Source: Classic Models DB ") +
  
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle=65, vjust=0.6))
```

The bar chart looks like this:

### Scenario 2:
In this scenario, we will use a pie chart from the library `ggplot2`, showing the product line by revenue. The library `tidyverse` will be used as well.
```bash
#Creating df_3
df_3 <-sqlQuery(conn1,"SELECT  productLine,
                        SUM(quantityOrdered*priceEach) AS TotalSalesVolume
                FROM    productlines
                        JOIN products USING (productLine)
                        JOIN orderdetails USING (productCode)
                GROUP BY    productLine
                ORDER BY    TotalSalesVolume DESC;")
#Plotting

library(tidyverse)#Remember to load this library for scenario 2

# Get the positions
df_4 <- df_3 %>% 
  mutate(csum = rev(cumsum(rev(TotalSalesVolume))), 
         pos = TotalSalesVolume/2 + lead(csum, 1),
         pos = if_else(is.na(pos), TotalSalesVolume/2, pos))

ggplot(df_3, aes(x = "", y = TotalSalesVolume, fill = fct_inorder(productLine))) +
  geom_col(width = 1, color = 1) +
  geom_text(aes(label = TotalSalesVolume,x=1.6),
            position = position_stack(vjust = 0.6)) +
  coord_polar(theta = "y") +
  guides(fill = guide_legend(title = "productLine")) +
  scale_y_continuous(breaks = df_4$pos, labels = df_3$productLine) +
  ggtitle("Product Line by Total Sales Volume")+
  theme(text = element_text(size = 20),
        axis.title = element_blank(),
        axis.text.x=element_blank(),
        axis.ticks.x=element_blank(),
        panel.background = element_rect(fill = "white"))
```

After running the code above, we get the following pie chart:

### Scenario 3:
Time for a diverging bar chart. In the example below, the total sales from the `df_5` dataset are normalized by computing the z-score. Those sales reps with total sales above zero are marked in green and those below are marked in red. No need to import the library `ggplot2` again.
```bash
#Creating df_5
df_5 <-sqlQuery(conn1,"SELECT CONCAT(firstName, ',', lastName) AS FIRSTNAME,
                      SUM(quantityOrdered*priceEach) AS totalSales
                      FROM    orderdetails JOIN orders USING (orderNumber)
                      JOIN customers USING (customerNumber)
                      JOIN employees ON
                      customers.salesRepEmployeeNumber = employees.employeeNumber
                      GROUP BY    salesRepEmployeeNumber
                      ORDER BY    totalSales DESC;")

#Initialising diverging barchart
theme_set(theme_bw())  

# Data Prep
data(datatable(df_5))  # load data
df_5$RepName <- row.names(df_5)  # create new column for car names
df_5$totalSales_z<- round((df_5$totalSales - mean(df_5$totalSales))/sd(df_5$totalSales), 2)  # compute normalized total sales
df_5$totalSales_type <- ifelse(df_5$totalSales_z < 0, "below", "above")  # above / below avg flag
df_5 <- df_5[order(df_5$totalSales_z), ]  # sort
df_5$RepName  <- factor(df_5$RepName, levels = df_5$RepName)  # convert to factor to retain sorted order in plot.

# Diverging barchart
ggplot(df_5, aes(x=RepName, y=totalSales_z, label=totalSales_z),) + 
  geom_bar(stat='identity', aes(fill=totalSales_type), width=.9)  +
  geom_text(aes(label = FIRSTNAME), hjust = 0.1,nudge_y = -.5,colour = "black",fontface="bold") +
  
  scale_fill_manual(name="Total Sales", 
                    labels = c("Above Average", "Below Average"),
                    values = c("above"="#00ba38", "below"="#f8766d")) + 
  labs(subtitle="Normalised total sales for Sales Reps", 
       title= "Diverging Bars") + 
  coord_flip()
```

After running the code above, we get the following diverging bar chart:

### Scenario 4:
A histogram on a categorical variable will result in a frequency chart showing bars for each category. In this example, we will get a visual for the product vendor across the product line.
```bash
#Creating df_6
df_6 <-sqlQuery(conn1,"select
                        productCode,
                        productName,
                        productLine,
                        productVendor
                        from classicmodels.products;")

theme_set(theme_classic())

# Histogram on a Categorical variable
g <- ggplot(df_6, aes(productVendor))
g + geom_bar(aes(fill=productLine), width = 0.5) + 
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle=65, vjust=0.6)) + 
  labs(title="Histogram on Categorical Variable", 
       subtitle="ProductVendor across productLine") 
```

### Scenario 5:
An ordered bar chart is a bar chart that is ordered by the Y-axis variable. Just sorting the dataframe by the variable of interest isnâ€™t enough to order the bar chart. In order for the bar chart to retain the order of the rows, the X-axis variable (i.e., the categories) has to be converted into a factor. Let us plot the mean `totalSales` for each `productName` from the `df7_pbr` dataset. First, aggregate the data and sort it before you draw the plot. Finally, the X variable is converted to a factor.
```bash
#Creating df_7
df_7 <-sqlQuery(conn1,"SELECT                                     
                      productName,
                              SUM(quantityOrdered*priceEach) AS totalSales
                      FROM    products JOIN
                              orderdetails USING (productCode)
                      GROUP BY    productCode
                      ORDER BY    totalSales DESC
                                    limit 40;")

# Prepare data: product name by revenue.
df7_pbr <- aggregate(df_7$totalSales, list(df_7$productName), mean)  # aggregate
colnames(df7_pbr) <- c("productName", "totalSales")  # change column names
df7_pbr  <- df7_pbr[order(df7_pbr$totalSales), ]  # sort
df7_pbr$productName <- factor(df7_pbr$productName , levels = df7_pbr$productName)  # to retain the order in plot.
head(df7_pbr, 4)
library(scales)
library(ggplot2)
theme_set(theme_bw())

# Draw plot
ggplot(df7_pbr, aes(x=productName, y=totalSales)) + 
  geom_bar(stat="identity", width=.5, fill="tomato3") + 
  scale_y_continuous(name="totalSales", labels = comma)+
  labs(title="Ordered Bar Chart", 
       subtitle="Product by Revenue", 
       caption="source: classicmodels db") + 
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle=65, vjust=0.6))
```

After running the code above, we get the following ordered bar chart:

### Scenario 6:
A treemap is a nice way of displaying hierarchical data by using nested rectangles. The `treemapify` package provides the necessary functions to convert the data into the desired format. In this example, categories will be `productline`, grouping all `productCode` in them.
```bash
#Creating df_8
df_8 <-sqlQuery(conn1,"SELECT
                        productLine, 
                        productCode,
                                SUM(quantityOrdered*priceEach) AS totalSales
                        FROM    products JOIN
                                orderdetails USING (productCode)
                        GROUP BY    productCode
                        ORDER BY    totalSales DESC;")

library(treemapify)#We need this library to get a treemap

# plot
ggplot(df_8, aes(area = totalSales, fill = productLine, label = productCode,subgroup = productLine)) +
  geom_treemap() +
  geom_treemap_subgroup_border(colour = "white", size = 5) +
  geom_treemap_subgroup_text(place = "centre", grow = TRUE,
                             alpha = 0.5, colour = "black",
                             fontface = "italic") +
  geom_treemap_text(colour = "white", place = "centre",
                    size = 15, grow = TRUE)
```

After running the code above, we get the following treemap:

### Scenario 7:
In the last scenario, we will learn how to plot data over a world map. This time, no connection to MySQL will be made. We insert values as shown in the picture below in line 191. Installing and importing the library `dplyr` is needed. The map is intended for showing office countries by revenue.
```bash
library(dplyr)#Import this library for this scenario

#Manually typing totalSales values for each of the countries
ddf = read.table(text="
country value
USA 3479192
UK 143651
Japan 457110
France 3083752
Australia 1147176
", header=T)
options(scipen=10000)#No scientific notation on legend
world <- map_data("world")

world %>%
  merge(ddf, by.x = "region", by.y = "country", all.x = T) %>%
  arrange(group, order) %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = long, y = lat, group = group, fill = value))+
  labs(title="World Map", 
       subtitle="Office countries by Revenue", 
       caption="source: classicmodels db") +
  geom_polygon()
```

After running the code above, we get the following world map:
